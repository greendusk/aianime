<p align="center"><font size="4" face="arial"><b>Final Fantasy
III vs. Final Fantasy VII:</b> The Ultimate Fate</font></p>

<p><font face="arial">Terra enters the Cafe and sees the whole
FFIII group sitting at a table. </font></p>

<p><br>
<font face="arial"><b>Terra:</b> Hi guys... what's happening!? <br>
<b>Edgar:</b> (is laying face down in a pool of his own vomit. He
slowly lifts his head) We're drinking ourselves to death. <br>
<b>Terra:</b> Eww... what's wrong!? Did someone die!? <br>
<b>Setzer:</b> No... but it's almost like that. We've been
replaced. <br>
<b>Terra:</b> Huh!? <br>
<b>Setzer:</b> Don't you get it!? Those stupid Final Fantasy VII
characters are the new craze. We're just something of the past. <br>
<b>Celes:</b> (crying) We're doomed! We 16 bit characters have no
chance against them!! <br>
<b>Terra:</b> Lighten up guys... we'll never be forgotten. We're
too cool. <br>
<b>Cyan:</b> (sarcastically) Sure... just like those poor FFII
guys were never forgotten. Puh! <br>
<b>Celes:</b> (wailing) Waahh! Do you remember what they did to
the FFII people, Terra!!? <br>
<b>Terra:</b> (shakes her head) No... <br>
<b>Celes:</b> THEY PUT THEM IN A KENNEL... then, then... PUT THEM
TO SLEEP!!! Waaaah! <br>
<b>Edgar:</b> Yes... then they made luggage out of their hides. <br>
<b>Shadow:</b> ...Oh yah! I remember! I bought the Cecil-LX
addition luggage set. Very sturdy and reliable. <br>
<b>Terra:</b> They did that!? (gasps) What are we going to do!? I
don't want to be luggage!! <br>
<b>Kefka:</b> (suddenly enters the room) Hi cry babies!! You
still all worried about those FFVII guys!? Mwa ha! <br>
<b>Sabin:</b> Why are you so happy Kefka? <br>
<b>Kefka:</b> Mwa ha, why should I be sad!? I'm the best bad guy
ever! No villain in that game can live up to my standards. <br>
<b>Relm:</b> SHUT UP, CLOWN BREATH!!! Your a looser! <br>
<b>Kefka:</b> HA! You just say that because your in denial...
besides I know I'm the best, I've got a cool theme song and an
annoying laugh! </font></p>

<p><br>
<font face="arial">Suddenly they all hear a loud noise outside.
They all race to the window and watch as a giant metallic airship
lands on top of the Falcon crushing it. </font></p>

<p><br>
<font face="arial"><b>Setzer:</b> MY SHIP!!! </font></p>

<p><font face="arial">A group of people get out of the monstrous
ship and look at the rubble they landed on. </font></p>

<p><br>
<font face="arial"><b>Cid:</b> What's this piece of shit!? <br>
<b>Cait Sith:</b> LOOK! A STARBUCKS!!! Come on guys lets get a
Caf√© Latte and talk about inane things!! <br>
<b>Cid:</b> I'm not going to that damn shack! <br>
<b>Yuffie:</b> (Jumps up and down) I want coffee! Coffee! COFFEE!
<br>
<b>Barret:</b> Oh no you don't! You know what caffeine does to
you! <br>
<b>Yuffie:</b> (Runs around in circles) Hyper! Hyper! Coffee!
CAFFEINE!!! <br>
<b>Cloud:</b> Someone shut her up..! <br>
<b>Tifa:</b> Lets just go in... okay? </font></p>

<p><font face="arial">Inside the cafe the FFIII people are
cowering in a corner huddled and whimpering like puppies. The
FFVII characters enter. Cait Sith and Yuffie race up to the
counter. </font></p>

<p><br>
<font face="arial"><b>Cait Sith:</b> (Shoves Yuffie) I got here
first! <br>
<b>Yuffie: </b>(Punches Cait Sith) NO! I was first! ME ME ME!!!! </font></p>

<p><br>
<font face="arial">As the two are quarreling Vincent ambles up to
the register. </font></p>

<p><br>
<font face="arial"><b>Vincent:</b> Ahem... one milk. <br>
<b>Cid:</b> (Laughs hysterically) HA! A milk! What a baby!!!! HA
HA! Baby wants milk! Baby Vincent needs a bottle!! <br>
<b>Vincent:</b> ..... <br>
<b>Aeris:</b> Hey! Look guys!!! (She points at the pitiful
shivering group crowded creatures) </font></p>

<p><br>
<font face="arial">Everyone freezes and stares blankly at each
other. </font></p>

<p><br>
<font face="arial"><b>Aeris:</b> (bends down and puts out her
hand and speaks in a high soothing voice) Come here... come on. I
wont hurt you guys. </font></p>

<p><br>
<font face="arial">Slowly Locke saunters out of the cluster on
all fours quivering. </font></p>

<p><br>
<font face="arial"><b>Aeris:</b> Shhh... come here little guy.
(she slowly reaches her hand out further and gently pats him on
the head) See... it's okay. <br>
<b>Yuffie:</b> (Pulls at Barret's arm) I want one, I want one! <br>
<b>Barret:</b> NO! You killed your last human pet! <br>
<b>Yuffie:</b> I didn't know that Draino would kill it! </font><br>
</p>

<p><font face="arial">Suddenly Kefka stands up. </font><br>
</p>

<p><font face="arial"><b>Kefka:</b> (puts hands on hips) Mwa ha
ha! So your the FFVII guys!! Ha what losers! I can take all of
you. Come on... give me you best shot! <br>
<b>Cid:</b> (Looks at Kefka and blinks) What the f**k is that
thing!? <br>
<b>Kefka:</b> (Annoyed) grrrr.... I'm the best villain of all
time!!!! <br>
<b>Cid:</b> HA! Give me a break! YOU!? ....a clown is the best
bad-guy ever!? HA HA! Don't make me laugh! <br>
<b>Kefka: </b>(Almost ready to cry) I'm the ...best. <br>
<b>Cid: </b>Your so ugly that they filmed &quot;Gorilla&#146;s in
the Mist&quot; in your shower!!! <br>
<b>Kefka: </b>(Holding back tears) I'm .....the......
b..e.s....t. <br>
<b>Red XIII:</b> I think he's crying? <br>
<b>Cid:</b> What a wuss! What a little shrimp! You short baby
munchkin! Your so small that you could hang glide on a damn
Dorrito! </font></p>

<p><br>
<font face="arial">Kefka runs out of the room crying. Suddenly he
comes running back in screaming. Sephiroth enters the room with
his Masamune drawn. </font></p>

<p><br>
<font face="arial"><b>Sephy:</b> Aha! I've finally found you
guys! (points sword at the Avalanche group) Now you will all die!
<br>
<b>Red XIII:</b> Hey... ahem, Sephiroth-san? Um... <br>
<b>Sephy:</b> (lowers his sword) Huh!? <br>
<b>Red XIII:</b> Um... that guy over there (motions towards
Kefka) ..um, thinks he's a better bad-guy than yourself. <br>
<b>Kefka:</b> ... (a giant sweat drop rolls down his head) <br>
<b>Sephy:</b> (raises the Masamune up tp Kefka's throat) Who...
or WHAT are you? <br>
<b>Kefka:</b> I....a..m ...the.... b.b...be..st. </font></p>

<p><font face="arial">The FFVII characters tip-toe to the exit.
Sephiroth sees them out of the cornor of his eye. </font></p>

<p><br>
<font face="arial"><b>Spehy:</b> HEY! This is some kind of folly!
So you Avalanche guys think you had me with this decoy (points at
Kefka). Well, it seems as if you underestimated me. </font></p>

<p><br>
<font face="arial">Sephiroth slaughters all the FFIII characters
with a single swipe of his blade.... </font></p>

<p><br>
<font face="arial"><b>Sephy:</b> (To FFVII people) And now
you.... <br>
<b>Cloud:</b> WAIT! I have an idea Seph.. how about we stop
trying to kill eachother for one day and go to Hawaii for a
break. (holds out hand) <br>
<b>Sephy:</b> Hmmm.... (ponders) ...fine (shakes hands) but only
for today! Then I go back to my evil ways! <br>
<b>Everyone:</b> DEAL! </font></p>

<p><br>
<font face="arial">On a sunny beach in Hawaii everyone is
languishing in the sun. </font></p>

<p><br>
<font face="arial"><b>Cait Sith:</b> (sighs) This is the life... <br>
<b>Red XIII:</b> Agreed.. Wait, why won't Vincent change into his
swimsuit!? <br>
<b>Cid:</b> (laughs) He's to embarrassed to show off his
white-ass legs! <br>
<b>Vincent: </b>TAKE THAT BACK!! </font></p>

<p><br>
<font face="arial">Cid and Vincent start fighting. </font></p>

<p><br>
<font face="arial"><b>Sephiroth:</b> (Lifts up his sunglasses)
Hey! Yuffie! Get me some sun tan lotion out of my suitcase! <br>
<b>Yuffie:</b> Okay! (runs over to the suitcase... she reads the
label: &quot;Kefka-LX addition&quot;) </font></p>
