<p align="center"><font size="4" face="arial">A Day in Shin-Ra</font><font face="arial"> </font></p>

<p><font face="arial">In the small bar in Midgar City No. 7 Cloud
and Tifa were sacked out on the couch watching the big screen TV.
The TV droned, &quot;Next up on Midgar&#146;s Super Channel&#133;
The Dukes of Hazard Marathon! 16 hours of pure viewing
satisfaction!&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="arial">&quot;Urk! Change the channel, Cloud!&quot;
Tifa moaned. </font></p>

<p><font face="arial">Cloud slowly picked up the remote control
when suddenly Cid&#146;s ear pricing whine could be heard from up
stairs. &quot;NO! Don&#146;t you dare turn channels!&quot; A
platform with a pinball machine came buzzing down. Cid stood on
the landing with his trademark cigarette hanging from the side of
his mouth. &quot;You all know that I LOVE The Dukes of
Hazard!&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="arial">&quot;Get real! Nobody likes that
godforsaken show!&quot; Cloud said switching channels. </font></p>

<p><font face="arial">&quot;Damn you!&quot; Cid grabbed Cloud by
the collar. &quot;Shithead! Change back now!!!&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="arial">&quot;Shut up Cid! Look.&quot; Tifa pointed
to the screen. </font></p>

<p><font face="arial">Cid slowly let go of Cloud and they all
stared at the TV. The Shin-Ra logo flashed on the screen and then
disappeared to reveal Reno, smiling decisively. </font></p>

<p><font face="arial">&quot;Huh!? What is that weasel doing on
TV?&quot; Cid said. </font></p>

<p><font face="arial">&quot;Hello and welcome friendly citizens
of the beautiful city of Midgar.&quot; Reno began. &quot;Rufus
finally let me touch the TV equipment and is allowing me to bring
to you LIVE a complete tour of the Shin-Ra building and staff.
Rufus feels that you, the people of Midgar, should know more
about the people that have complete domination and control over
you. And so here I am.. at your service.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="arial">Suddenly the image on the screen shakes and
an image of white linoleum and black shoes appear. </font></p>

<p><font face="arial">&quot;Damn it Rude! Don&#146;t drop the
freaking camera! Rufus will kick my ass if you break that!&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="arial">&quot;Sorry, Mr. Perfect! It only weights a
ton.&quot; Rude mumbled as he picked up the camera. </font></p>

<p><font face="arial">&quot;Heh heh&#133;&quot; A giant sweat
drop roles down his head. &quot;Anyway.. lets get started. As you
all should know I am Reno &#133; the leader of the Turks&#133;
and---&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="arial">&quot;Your not the leader.&quot; Rude
stated </font></p>

<p><font face="arial">&quot;Fine then!&quot; Reno folded his arms
and looked away. &quot;Now just shut up.. your supposed to be the
camera man&#133; don&#146;t say anything.&quot; Reno cleared his
throat. &quot;Ahem&#133; I&#146;m not the leader.. I&#146;m just
one of the Turks. And the *looser* holding the camera is my
partner, the ..</font><font size="1" face="arial">bald</font><font face="arial">.. Rude.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="arial">&quot;What!? I heard that Reno!! I&#146;m
not bald! I shave my head! I want it this way!!&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="arial">&quot;Sure.. that&#146;s what you want them
to belive.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="arial">&quot;Whatever Reno&#133; The chicks dig
the baldness. Besides, at least I can *get* a date. Unlike a
certain someone I know.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="arial">&quot;What!!? I can get a girlfriend!&quot;
</font></p>

<p><font face="arial">&quot;When was the last time you had a
date&#133; RENO!?&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="arial">Reno&#146;s eyes fill with fire. &quot;SHUT
UP!! Don&#146;t tell the world about my love life!!&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="arial">Rude mumbles under his breath. &quot;</font><font size="1" face="arial">What love life</font><font face="arial">..?&quot;
Then smiles friendly at Reno. &quot;Um, sure buddy.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="arial">Reno grumbles. &quot;Anyway&#133;&#133;.
lets continue. The room next to me is the *lovely* Elena&#146;s
quarters. Lets see if she is in..&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="arial">Reno opens the door and Elena is in the
middle of dressing. She lets out a blood curdling scream and
tries to cover herself. &quot;AHHHHHHH!!! Get out of here you
peeping-toms!!&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="arial">An enormous sweat drop appears on both Reno
and Rude. </font></p>

<p><font face="arial">&quot;Uh.. oh! S.. sorry Elena.. I.. I
didn&#146;t know.. heh he.&quot; Reno stuttered. </font></p>

<p><font face="arial">Elena throws her shoes at Reno and Rude.
&quot;Quite starring and leave, you perverts!!!&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="arial">Reno closes the door and blushes.
&quot;Uhhh&#133;..? That was Elena.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="arial">Suddenly Tseng runs up to Reno and Rude
with a concerned look on his face. &quot;What&#146;s wrong? I
heard Elena screaming.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="arial">&quot;Uhhh.. heh.. well.. um&#133; uh..
nothing, Sir. We were just.. uh, talking.. umm.. ya..&quot; Reno
stammered. </font></p>

<p><font face="arial">Rude zooms into Reno&#146;s eyeball.
&quot;The eyes of a liar.&quot; Rude said sternly. </font></p>

<p><font face="arial">Suddenly Elena&#146;s door swings open and
Elena storms out .. fully clothed now&#133; and slaps Reno with a
force that sends him flying across the room. </font></p>

<p><font face="arial">&quot;What happened!?&quot; Tseng asked
Elena. </font></p>

<p><font face="arial">Elena&#146;s eyes filled with tears. </font></p>

<p><font face="arial">&quot;Tseng-San! It was horrible! Reno saw
me naked and Rude was filming it!! Waaaaaaahhhhhh!!!&quot; Elena
rushes to Tseng&#146;s arms and he embraces her. Tseng looks up
angrily at Rude who is still filming. </font></p>

<p><font face="arial">A sweat drop appears on his bald head. Reno
then stumbles over to Rude rubbing the side of his face where a
giant red imprint of a hand is. Suddenly the elevator door opens
and Rufus storms out. He marches over to the Turks. </font></p>

<p><font face="arial">Rufus does his trademark of flipping the
hair from his eyes &quot;Reno! Rude! What in hell do you think
your doing!!!?&quot; Rufus demanded, he then looked really
weirdly at Elena. Elena burrowed her face in Tseng&#146;s
shoulder. Rufus continued. &quot;I have never seen a more sorry
group of people in my life!! This isn&#146;t a tour
it&#146;s&#133; it&#146;s a freak show!!&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="arial">&quot;M.. M, Mister President!? I ..I can
explain!&quot; Reno whined. </font></p>

<p><font face="arial">&quot;Don&#146;t you dare start
explaining!! I saw the whole thing you pathetic sap! Reno, this
is the last t&#151;&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="arial">Suddenly Sephiroth materializes next to
Reno. &quot;Hi.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="arial">&quot;--? Oh, hi Sephiroth! ..Um anyway..
as I was saying Reno.. this is the last.. ----!!?&quot; Rufus
pauses. &quot;Sephiroth!? What are you doing here! Ahk!&quot;
Rufus hides behind Rude. &quot;Don&#146;t kill me like my father.
I mean If you absolutely have to, at least make it fast. I&#146;d
prefer not to be fried.. well if you do don&#146;t touch the
hair&#133; and if you stab me I&#146;d like it to be fast..
because I don&#146;t want to cough up blood all over my new white
suit. Oh and if you use ice I&#151;&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="arial">&quot;Shut up!&quot; Sephiroth interrupted.
&quot;No.. I came here to ask a favor. I wanted to know if you
guys have any of those yummy chocolate donuts? But first.. turn
off that camera.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="arial">Suddenly Sephiroth raises his Masamune and
slashes&#133; and all is static. Cloud, Tifa, and Cid all stare
blankly at the screen. Cid bursts into laughter. </font></p>

<p><font face="arial">&quot;Ha ha! Those Shin-Ra&#146;s are
losers!&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="arial">&quot;I heard that!&quot; Cait Sith yelled
from up stairs. </font></p>

<p><font face="arial">&quot;Ya.. and that Elena is pretty
hot.&quot; Cloud blushed. </font></p>

<p><font face="arial">&quot;What!!!?&quot; Tifa said hitting
Cloud on the head.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="arial"><b>The End</b>&#133; um..
sorta (crappy ending.. huh!? ^^;;;) </font></p>
