<p><font face="arial">The following is a paid advertisement for: <b>Kefka
Quality Toys</b> </font><font size="1" face="arial">(tm)</font></p>

<p><font face="arial"><b>Kefka:</b> &quot;Greetings slackers! I
am here to show all you worthless people my line of WONDERFUL
Kefka toys. Today woth me is ..ahem.. The (brain damaged) King of
Figaro. He's outside interveiwing people about my WONDEROUS toys.
But before we talk to him lets look at the products.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="arial">Kefka takes out a 12&quot; plastic action
figure. The &quot;audience-in-a-can&quot; gasps.</font></p>

<p><font face="arial"><b>Kefka:</b> &quot;This is a number one
selling toy. It's the Official Kefka Action Figure! Watch
this...&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="arial">Kefka presses a button on the back of the
toy and the eyes begin toflash red and a grainy/muffled noise
plays: &quot;Mwaaaaa haaaaa haaaaa haaaaa Mwaaaaa haaaaa haaaaa
haaaaa!&quot; The auseince-in-a-can&quot; cheers.</font></p>

<p><font face="arial"><b>Kefka:</b> &quot;WONDERFUL isn't it? The
CHARMING laugh is an actual recording of yours truly and features
the Kefka Quality Sound System, which makes it sound life like.
If you purchase one now I'll include the Kefka Gift Rebate which
gives you 2 cents off your next purchase. But hold on! There are
more products! Like this one...&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="arial">Kefka takes out a plush toy and holds it up
to the camera.</font></p>

<p align="center"><img src="drinkwet.gif"></p>

<p><font face="arial"><b>Kefka:</b> &quot;Mwa ha. Looks just like
me, huh? This is the Baby Kefka Drink 'n Wet doll! It comes with
a bottle and two changes of diapers (other accessories sold
seperately). It drinks and wets with ease. Observe...&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="arial">Kefka takes the bottle at begins to feed
the doll. The plush doll blissfully drinks. Suddenly the doll
inhales the whole bottle. The doll begins to vibrate as the
bottle is shredded in the motor inside.</font></p>

<p><font face="arial"><b>Kefka:</b> &quot;Now lets see the little
suprise it left!&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="arial">Kefka opens the plush creature's diaper and
glass shrapnel flies out of the doll's buttocks. Kefka ducks to
dodge the serrated glass chunks and fake milk that is spraying
through the air. Finally Kefka grabs the doll and slams it into
the wall and it slides down and twitches on the ground.</font></p>

<p><font face="arial"><b>Kefka:</b> &quot;Umm... that's supposed
to happen. Uh, lets see the next toy.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="arial">Kefka takes out a pair of slippers and
squeezes one of them. A garbled sound comes out: &quot;MWAAAA
HAAA HAAAA MWAAAAA HAAA!&quot; The &quot;audience-in-a-can&quot;
claps.</font></p>

<p align="center"><img src="slippers.gif"></p>

<p><font face="arial"><b>Kefka: </b>&quot;These stylish slippers
not only feture my own Kefka Quality Sound System, but if you
order now I'll give you a Kefka Rebate Cupon which will allow you
to get Kefka Pajamas for FREE! Now that you've seen the stuff
lets see what other people think. We'll go outside on the streets
with Edgar.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="arial">In Mobliz...</font></p>

<p><font face="arial">The camera turns towards a green-haired
women, Terra. She stares blankly into the camera.</font></p>

<p><font face="arial"><b>Edgar:</b> &quot;What's your name?&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="arial"><b>Terra:</b> &quot;Edgar, you know my name

'These slippers cured my arthiritis and improved my love life!'
... Oh, never mind. Umm.. next to me is Setzer Gabbiani. He has

<p><font face="arial">Setzer puts on his glasses.</font></p>

<p><font face="arial"><b>Setzer: </b>&quot;Damn. I can't even
read it with my glasses. And what is this thing?&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="arial">Setzer looks at the Drink 'n Wet doll with
disgust.</font></p>

<p><font face="arial"><b>Setzer:</b> &quot;This thing sucks! It's
a piece of crap! Not only that but I get the chills looking at
it... look at the mug on this thing! It makes me ill.&quot;</font></p>
