<p><font size="4" face="arial"><b>President Shinra</b></font><font face="arial"> - President of the Shin-Ra Company</font> </p>

<p><font face="arial"><b>Appearance:</b> Red business suit,
bright yellow hair, hideous mustache, and trademark cigar.
(Perhaps a Slim Fast diet might be a good idea for this guy...
don't you think!? ^^;;) </font></p>

<p><font face="arial"><b>Personality Analisis: </b>He is only
known to us as President Shin-Ra. He was the mastermind and
founder of the Shin-Ra corporation. His relationship with his
son, Rufus Shinra.. was most likely only professional.. I don't
think the two went on very many Father, Son, fishing trips. The
whereabouts of his wife are a mystery to me. But I know she
exists... yep.. you hear about her in the Honey Bee Inn.. when
your spying on the President .. (Ya RIGHT, Mr. President! What an
interesting idea for a dinner party.) he heh.. Ummm.. Anyway... </font></p>

<p><font face="arial">President Shinra is a corrupted.. evil...
yet cunning ruler . He gets what he wants.. when he wants it by
ruling Midgar by money. But he had his sights set on higher
things... The Promised Land. Neo-Midgar was his next goal.. build
a new.. bigger .. better Midgar on the Promised Land. Unlimited
Mako energy.... and and endless stream of money for him.
Unfortunately his reign of terror was cut short.. thanks to
Sephiroth. Rufus, Shinra's boy, takes his &quot;old man's&quot;
place as ruler of Shinra Inc. </font></p>

<p><a name="rufus"></a><font face="arial"> </font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="arial"><b>Rufus Shinra</b></font><font face="arial"> - Vice President of the Shin-Ra Company </font></p>

<p><font face="arial"><b>Age:</b> I believe he's about 23 years
old..</font></p>

<p><font face="arial"><b>Hieght:</b> About 5'8&quot; or 5'9&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="arial"><b>Weapon:</b> Rufus is skilled at using
his handy dandy double barreled shot gun to get himself out of a
pickle. Although he's not a skilled fighter... he can still kick
butt, especially teamed up with his pet black panther. But when a
situation gets too hot.. he'll call it quits and take a powder. </font></p>

<p><font face="arial"><b>Eye color:</b> Dark blue </font></p>

<p><font face="arial"><b>Hair color:</b> Rufus' hair is bright
orange/yellow and combed to his left and three bangs hang loosely
down over his eyes. Rufus has a habit of flipping his hair away
from his eyes with his hand.. *drool... how dreamy* (^_^). </font></p>

<p><font face="arial"><b>Formal Atirre:</b> He wears a black mock
turtle-neck under a totally chic white business suit and tops it
off with a cool flowing white drench coat.. and brown boots. </font></p>

<p><font face="arial"><b>Personality Analisis: </b>Rufus is
young, sly, arrogant, and self-centered. He is Vice-President of
the Shin-Ra Electric Company and son of President Shin-Ra. Rufus
and his &quot;old man&quot; most likely didn't have a very close
relationship. And I believe he dosen't care very much for his
mother. In fact Rufus spent most of his time assigned in Junon. </font></p>

<p><font face="arial">Growing up as an only child of the richest
man on the planet.. your bound to acquire &quot;spoiled brat
syndrome&quot; and at that, I imagine his parents didn't have
very much time for him (probably had servants take care of him).
He probably resented his parents for that. </font></p>

<p><font face="arial">After the death of his father, Vice
President Rufus declares himself the new President. He claims
that he will &quot;...rule by fear, not money....&quot; like his
father. </font></p>

<p><font face="arial"><b>My Thoughts: </b>Rufus is my personal
favorite character in the game. I just happen to be fan of
carrot-tops... and business suits (i.e. Conan O'Brien). So he is
BEYOND perfect in my eyes! To tell the complete truth I cried
more when Rufus died then when Aeris OR Sephiroth die. After his
FMV.. I sat there in my room holding the controller staring
blankly at the screen... then bursted into tears. Then for hours
after I was in complete denial that he was gone... I kept on
saying &quot;My Rufus! My baby Rufy-wufy.. is... gone! I'll never
see him run his hand through his hair again.. he'll never be
angry at Hiedegger, yell at soldiers, or hear his monotonous
parade theme again!&quot; And after he dies the Shin-Ra Company
go to hell in a handbag... goes to show.. he was the only one
holding the corporation together. </font></p>

<p><a name="scarlet"></a><font size="4" face="arial"><b>Scarlet</b></font><font face="arial"> - Head of Weapons Development Division </font></p>

<p><font face="arial"><b>Appearance: </b>Light blue eyes,
greenish/yellow hair pulled into a messy bun, sleazy long red
slip-dress, red pumps, and trashy lingerie. </font></p>

<p><font face="arial"><b>Personality Analisis: </b>Probably best
remembered by her irritating laugh: &quot;Kya ha ha ha!&quot; ...
Scarlet, Manager of Weapons Development, is obsessed with finding
the Promised Land as much as President Shinra, himself. She is
just as twisted and evil as her creations, like the Sister-Ray
(the giant cannon in Junon), the Airbuster Robot, Proud Clod, and
many other maniacal contraptions. She seems to enjoy inflicting
pain and suffering on others. (i.e. Barret getting his arm shot
off and the burning of his village, Tifa public execution in the
gas chamber). When it comes to fighting.. well... can anyone say
bitch slap fight!? (^-^;) As for relationships in Shin-Ra Inc., I
wouldn't be surprised if she has slept with everyone in the
Shin-Ra building (save Reeve.. remember... they <b><u>despise</u></b>
each other) </font></p>

<p><font face="arial"><b>Favorite Quote: <br>
</b>Scarlet: &quot;But, even if we make the perfect weapon, could
that stupid Heidegger even use it?&quot;<br>

<p><a name="heidegger"></a><font size="4" face="arial"><b>Heidegger</b></font><font face="arial"> - Head of Public Maintenance and Order </font></p>

<p><font face="arial"><b>Appearance: </b>Extremely obese, short,
and squat. Green military ensemble, brown eyes, mid-length black
hair, long beard, and scar on right side of his face. </font></p>

<p><font face="arial"><b>Personality Analisis:</b> How can you
not forget his infamous horse laugh: &quot;Gya ha ha ha!&quot;
... Heidegger, incharge of the safety of Midgar, controls the
Shin-Ra army and the Turks. Yep.. that's right! He's the one who
sics the Turks on Avalanche throughout the game. But cut the guy
some slack. Poor Heidegger, he's not noted for his brains (in
fact .. he's a regular knuckle head) and no one in particular
likes him. After numerous failed attempts at trying to stop
Avalanche, being yelled at by Rufus.. saying how much of a looser
he is, and having his reputation shredded up.. you'd be a little
on the grumpy side and beat the crap out of you troops too. So be
nice to him! </font></p>

<p><font face="arial"><b>Appearance: </b>Short, fat, and round,
with classic male patter baldness which leave him with sparse
little gray puffs of hair. Wears a tan business suit with a
yellow bow tie. </font></p>

<p><font face="arial"><b>Personality Analisis: </b>As Cid refers
to him, &quot;Fatman&quot; (.. although Palmer despises being
called &quot;Fat&quot; .. ^-^) He's not the serious type.. dances
... jumps up and down.. and sings. Palmer is <i>supposed</i> to
be in charge of Space Development.. but when the Shin-Ra 26
rocket launch was canceled, so did funding for the Space Program.
But Palmer still hangs around the Shin-Ra building stuffing his
face with &quot;Lard Donuts&quot; and goes to the Shin-Ra board
meetings.. begging for money for the Space Program from the
President. </font></p>

<p><a name="reeve"></a><font size="4" face="arial"><b>Reeve</b></font><font face="arial"> - Head of City Development Division </font></p>

<p><font face="arial"><b>Appearance: </b>Has dark brown eyes,
mid-length black hair, and a (kakkoii) goatee. Usually wears a
dark blue business suit and red tie. </font></p>

<p><font face="arial"><b>Personality Analisis: </b>Reeve, in
charge of City Development, was the one who originally drew up
the plans for Midgar. Reeve is probably the only Shin-Ra
Executive that has his head screwed on right. He is the only one
who isn't drivin by money and actually cares about the people of
Midgar. When President Shin-Ra proposes that they will destroy
Section 7. Reeve is the only is one that objects. President
Shinra just tells him to take a few days off. </font></p>

<p><font face="arial">Reeve is the one who controls Cait Sith..
at first as a spy for Shin-Ra. He spies on Avalanche and steals
the keystone from Cloud and friends and take Marlene (Barret's
daughter) hostage and forces them to cooperate with Shin-Ra. But
Reeve soon discovers how corrupted Shin-Ra actually is and uses
the robot, Cait Sith, to listen in on Shin-Ra.. so Avalanche can
see what them Rufus and Co. are up to. So Reeve is actually a
good guy.... that traitor! (^_-) </font></p>

<p><font face="arial"><b>Appearance: </b>Thin and pale (almost
sickly looking.. drinking too much of your chemical potions
lately, Professor Hojo?) Wears white lab coat, little specs, and
long black hair pulled back in a pony tail. </font></p>

<p><font face="arial"><b>Personality Analisis: </b>Hojo is what
we call... mentally troubled. (^_^) Hojo was always referred to
as &quot;Second Best&quot; .. never as good as his predecessor,
Professor Gast. This dove Hojo crazy.. so crazy that he made it
his life to prove that he is a better scientist then, Gast. The
Reunion .. is Hojo's calculating experiment to prove that he's

<b>(Otherwise known as -- the Turks)</b> <br>
</font><font size="1" face="arial">(</font><font color="#FF0000" size="1" face="arial">note:</font><font size="1" face="arial">
age, hieght, and some info here are just.. guesses.. I'm not sure
if they are true ^^;) </font></p>

<p><font face="arial">The Turks are an organization in Shin-Ra.
They scout for possible candidates for SOLDIER. They are also
involved in a lot of dirty stuff on the side, like spying,
kidnapping, and murder. </font></p>

<p><a name="tseng"></a><font size="4" face="arial"><b>Tseng</b></font><font face="arial"> - Leader of the Turks </font></p>

<p><font face="arial"><b>Age:</b> Oooh.. this is a tough one..
(^_^) I would guess he's about.. 38 or 39. Allow me to explain.
Aeris has known Tseng ever since she was a child.. for
practically her whole life Tseng.. a Turk ...has been after her.
Now remember that flashback that Elmyra (Aeris' mom) talks about
after Midgar no. 7 is blown up. The one about how she found
Aeris.. and how Shin-Ra was after her. Tseng was at least 22 in
that flashback with Aeris, and she was about 5. Do the math
and... </font><font size="1" face="arial">(*mumble mumble*.. lets
see .. Aeris is 22 years old.. minus 5.. that's 17.. 17 plus
Tseng's age in the flashback, 22... that about.. 39!) </font><font face="arial">You see.. so it all makes sense! (O_o) Hey.. it's a
pretty good guess.. </font></p>

<p><font face="arial"><b>Hieght:</b> I'd say... about,
5'11&quot;. </font></p>

<p><font face="arial"><b>Weapon:</b> I haven't seen Tseng fight..
but I do imagine that he is extremley skilled at hand guns and
can probably kick some major butt in some good old fashion
hand-to-hand combat.</font></p>

<p><font face="arial"><b>Eye color:</b> Dark grey (almost black) </font></p>

<p><font face="arial"><b>Hair color:</b> Jet black, mid length
hair that he slicks back. </font></p>

<p><font face="arial"><b>Formal Atirre:</b> The official Turks
uniform: a chic navy blue business suit, white button up dress
shirt, black tie, and open finger black gloves. </font></p>

<p><font face="arial"><b>Personality Analisis: </b>Tseng-san,
best identified as the guy with the dot on his forehead. </font><font size="2" face="arial">(Those bindi dot things are supposed to be
the newest rage here in California.. I don't know about the rest
of the world? Hey.. Tseng is trendy! ^-^) </font><font face="arial">Being leader of the Turks, he takes his job very
seriously and manages to stay cool, calm, and collective. He
doesn't very often accompany the other Turks during their
missions.. (He lets Reno and Rude do the &quot;dirty&quot; work).
But, he makes sure they accomplish each mission successfully. He
is usually assigned the more important stuff.. such as bodyguard
for the President.. and flying the Shin-Ra helicopter... etc.</font></p>

<p><font face="arial">Tseng has romantic feelings towards Aeris..
(although she is the Turks kidnapping target). It's quite evident
throughout the first CD .. that he likes her. Tseng says to Aeris
&quot;Well, I won't be seeing much of you, so take care.&quot;
and &quot;...stay out of Shin-Ra's way.&quot; .... Yet.. he did
slap her that one time (^^;;)</font></p>

<p><font face="arial">Tseng's life is unfortunately cut short ..
after &quot;stealing&quot; the Keystone, he was assigned to go on
a mission to the Temple of the Ancients with Elena to search for
clues to the whereabouts of the Promised land.. after finding a
strange hieroglyph room he tells Elena to report their findings
to President Rufus and then asks her if she'd like to go on a
date with him after this mission was complete. She (having a
major crush on Tseng) agrees.. and tells him to be careful.. and
leaves. A few moments later he is confronted by Sephiroth.. and
stabbed in the stomach and left to die in the Temple. And if you
remember correctly .. you see Tseng when you enter the Temple...
that is after he'd been stabbed by Seph. He says he'll pull out
of it.. but really.. his wounds are too serious and isn't able to
get out.. and gets SMASHED when the Temple is transformed into
the Black Materia. (-_-,) I cried... poor Tseng. </font></p>

<p><font face="arial"><b>Age:</b> He is probably about 35 years
old. <br>
Well.. he doesn't look very young.. and doesn't look too old. </font></p>

<p><font face="arial"><b>Hieght: </b>I'm saying he's probably
6'0&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="arial"><b>Weapon: </b>Reno is a skilled fighter
with a nightstick!</font></p>

<p><font face="arial"><b>Eye color:</b> Aqua/Blue</font></p>

<p><font face="arial"><b>Hair color: </b>Dark red spikey hair
that he has pulled back in a loose messy ponytail and always has
a pair of sunglasses ready to wear resting above his head. He
also has two battle scars on either side of his face and has an
earring.. </font><font size="2" face="arial">(if you stare at </font><a href="My%20Web%20Page/turks.jpg"><font size="2" face="arial">turks.jpg</font></a><font size="2" face="arial"> for hours on end ... like me... you can
see it too.)</font></p>

<p><font face="arial"><b>Formal Atirre:</b> The official Turks
uniform.. yet, he doesn't have his suit as tidy as the rest of
the Turks. He leaves his shirt un-tucked, wrinkled, the top
buttons undone, and doesn't wear a tie. </font></p>

<p><font face="arial"><b>Personality Analisis:</b> Reno is very
relaxed, carefree, and sociable compared to the rest of the
group. Rude is Reno's drinking buddy/best friend. Reno once said
to Rude: &quot;Drink, Rude! How long have we been a team...?
There have been hard times being a Turk, but all in all, I'm glad
I did it. I even got to meet a bunch of wing nuts like you.&quot;
You can usually find the two of them gossiping about which girl
they like ... and don't like... or anything not pertaining to
their mission. Reno would rather read a Playboy and get drunk
during beak time.. then discuss the matters at hand. But his
insouciant, free-and-easy personality may give people the wrong
impression. Reno fulfills every mission successfully and
professionally. </font></p>

<p><font face="arial">Reno is actually the first Turk you meet in
the game. He first comes in contact with Cloud at the Sector 5
slums church when Reno was in pursuit of Aeris (remember.. this
is when he rudely smashes Aeris' flowers ^^;;). Cloud later comes
into contact with him at the top of the tower in Sector 7, when
he's setting up the bomb. But in this confrontation Cloud and
friends battle it out with Reno... but being the true Turk that
he is .. he ditches the fight. But he was wounded badly from this
fight... so bad, that he was temporarily unable to perform any
missions.. leaving Shin-Ra a Turk short. This forced Tseng to
hire on a new member ....Elena. Of course Reno was able to
recover from his wounds and rejoins the group. </font></p>

<p><font face="arial">Perhaps my favorite moment in the game was
when Reno and Rude came to the rescue, after Elena and Yuffie
were kidnapped by the pervert, Don Corneo. I loved it when Reno
sent Corneo to his well deserved demise! Go Reno.. (^o^) you
handsome man, you!</font></p>

for his job. That's just a fool!&quot; (my motto ^_-)</font></p>

<p><a name="rude"></a><font size="4" face="arial"><b>Rude</b></font><font face="arial"> - Turks Member </font></p>

<p><font face="arial"><b>Age: </b>He is probably 37 or 38. For
one thing, he looks alot older then Reno.</font></p>

<p><font face="arial"><b>Hieght:</b> I'm guessing about 6'4&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="arial"><b>Weapon:</b> Rude is skilled at the usage
of guns and sniper riffles... but is the best when it comes to
hand-to-hand combat.</font></p>

<p><font face="arial"><b>Eye color:</b> Unknown. His eyes are
always obscured by a pair of kakkoii sunglasses.</font></p>

<p><font face="arial"><b>Hair color:</b> Tee hee! (^_^) He's
bald! But he's got a thin beard/goatee thing going and has
multiple earrings (Hey! He's Mr. Clean!) </font></p>

<p><font face="arial"><b>Formal Atirre:</b> He wears the whole
Turk ensemble and has a little handkerchief tucked in his left
pocket .. (Oohhh ....how cute ^-^;;) </font></p>

<p><font face="arial"><b>Personality Analisis: </b>Rude,
dedicated Turk and alcoholic, is a man of few words. He doesn't
have a lot to say.. and when he does it's not very much. Having
his eyes covered by his omnipresent pair of predator-style
sunglasses, makes it hard to read his face. Reno seems to be the
only one who can keep a conversation going with this guy (of
course they are usually both drunk out of their minds). He is
very serious when it comes to his job, he follows his orders with
out question. His stern, cold exterior may give people the wrong
impression. Rude.. cares a lot about his friend Reno, Shin-Ra,
and the &quot;spirit&quot; of the Turks. In fact each time he has
a drink he says: &quot;To the Turks .... To Reno ...
cheers!&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="arial">Reno often asks Rude who he likes and
doesn't like.. (the Love Triangle.. ur.. Hexagon). Rude seems to
have a crush on Elena.. but he thinks he doesn't have a chance,
because Elena likes Tseng. Rude also has feelings for Tifa. YES!
You heard me.. Tifa Lockheart! (^_^) But he doesn't allow his
feelings to get in the way of his work. Reno even told Rude:
&quot;Don't go easy on them just because they're girls.&quot;
Rude responded by saying, &quot;...Don't worry, I'll do my
job.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="arial"><b>Favorite Quote:</b> <br>

<p><font face="arial"><b>Age: </b>She's a youngin'! Probably only
20 years old.</font></p>

<p><font face="arial"><b>Hieght: </b>5'3&quot; (without those
killer heels)</font></p>

<p><font face="arial"><b>Weapon: </b>Elena ... I imagine, she's a
novice when it comes to guns. But she is deadly when uses
grenades combined with kicking and punching attacks.</font></p>

<p><font face="arial"><b>Eye color: </b>Brown</font></p>

<p><font face="arial"><b>Hair color: </b>Short cut, platinum
blonde hair</font></p>

<p><font face="arial"><b>Formal Atirre: </b>She wears the female
cut version of the Turks uniform with black platform-style pumps.</font></p>

<p><font face="arial"><b>Personality Analisis:</b> Elena is the
newbie of the group and doesn't really know how things work. She
is kind of ditzy and a bit of a loud mouth. Tseng and Reno
continuously tell her: &quot;You talk to much, Elena&quot;
through out the whole game. (^^;) After Reno was wounded ..
Shin-Ra Inc. was short a Turk. Enter Elena. I'm guessing she was
probably a secretary at Shin-Ra before she got promoted (maybe
Rufus' secretary? ...Hey I can speculate.. can't I..? ^-^) </font></p>

<p><font face="arial">Elena obediently obeys Tseng's orders the
best she can and tries her hardest to be a good Turk. She takes
the job seriously and does what she thinks is the right way. But,
Reno and Rude take advantage of her sweet and innocent
personality. She follows the two of them around during missions
(and vacations) doing their every command. (They even put her in
the front row during battles while they stay in the back. ^^;;;)</font></p>

<p><font face="arial">Elena had romantic feelings for her boss,
Tseng. Elena even says, &quot;It's so stupid! They always talk
about who they like or don't like. But Tseng is different.&quot;
when she hears Reno and Rude's romantic gossiping. When Tseng
finally did ask out Elena ... he was killed shortly after by
Sephiroth. She blames Cloud for Tseng's dead and is heartbroken.
(-_-,) Poor Elena. </font></p>
