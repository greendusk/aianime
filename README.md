# aianime

What is aianime? Well the TL;DR is that it is just my little take on a wayback machine of sites I loved in the late 90s. I think that we can do a better job than the wayback machine.

My Hope is that others like start rebuilding some of these out site. Think of it as a Retomod. Taking these old sites and making it some that people can see them.
